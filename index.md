# ERDC Proteus Workshop, Nov 15-16, 2017

The [Proteus Computational Methods and Simulation Toolkit](https://github.com/erdc/proteus) is a Python package for solving partial differential equations. It is one of the core ERDC tools being developed to support Fluid-Structure Interaction analysis for a range of applications, including:

- moored platforms and bridges,
- flood protection structures,
- granular materials (soil and sea ice), and
- autonomous vessels and vehicles.

**The overarching objective of this meeting is to help researchers use and extend Proteus**

# Location

**Rm 519** (Coastal Processes Classroom), Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory
